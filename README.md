This repository contains the implementation of the design of loadable mod-12 counter in Verilog and layered testbench in SystemVerilog to verify the design by integrating functional coverage and assertions using Siemens Questasim.

The Counter folder contains 2 files :-
1) "counter.sv" - this file contains the design code of loadable mod-12 counter, assertions module code and layered testbench code which integrates functional coverage and assertions.
2) "Makefile" - this file is used to compile the program, run the program, generate code, functional and combined coverage reports and view these reports in firefox.
